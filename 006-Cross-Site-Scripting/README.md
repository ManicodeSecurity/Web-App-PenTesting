# Cross Site Scripting
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

## Search Query XSS
In the Security Shepherd UI, click `Field Training -> Cross Site Scripting 1`. The goal of `Cross Site Scripting One` Challenge is to take what we learned in lecture about the dangers of injecting scripts into a vulnerable web application.

Try several different XSS payloads to see which ones are successful. 

Hint: The input is filtered so the basic `<script>alert(xss)</script>` may not work!

## Moar XSS Filter Bypasses
In the Security Shepherd UI, click `Sergeant -> Cross Site Scripting 2`. This challenge is similar to the previous one except more filtering is in place.

Tip: Try out a payload and then use the `View Source` functionality of the browser to see what is being filtered. XSS is all about trial and error.

## Bonus
A Polyglot XSS payload can be executed in multiple contexts. For example, `onclick=alert()` can be executed in and `onclick=alert()`. It is useful in Penetration Testing because it reduces the noise and minimizes the effort to test. Research XSS polyglots and expirement with them in the Security Shepherd XSS challenges.
