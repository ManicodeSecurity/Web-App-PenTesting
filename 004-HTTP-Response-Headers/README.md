# Analyze HTTP Response Headers
As a defender, HTTP Security Response Headers are an effective measure to mitigate a number of common security issues such as XSS, Clickjacking, and MitM attacks. As a PenTester understanding how these headers work and which ones exist can give you an edge on your attack. 

Viewing the HTTP response headers is a simple task. A number of tools can get the job done. We are going to use a popular website called [Security Headers](https://securityheaders.com) to analyze the HTTP security response headers of a few sites.

### Use Security Headers to Scan a Domain
Go to [Security Headers](https://securityheaders.com) and enter `manicode.us` into the input box. Check out the results and scan a few more domains.

### Bonus
Find a site that received an "F" grade and figure out why it would receive this grade.

### Discussion Question
Do you use any web frameworks that have built-in HTTP security header libraries? How are your headers being sent back to the browser in your applications?
