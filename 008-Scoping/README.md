## Scoping

We want to keep our testing environment as clean as possible and only actively test against domains that we are permitted to test. We use the concept of `Scoping` in our intercepting proxy to achieve this.

### Get Rid of the Noise
Web browsing is noisy. We can use the Scope feature of Burp Suite to ensure that we are only scanning and testing approved domains.

Here is what our `Proxy` tab would look like after getting a bit distracted during our Pen Test.

![Burp Pre Scope](../images/burp_pre_scope.png?raw=true "Burp Pre Scope")

1. Right click on the domain you would like to add to scope. We will use the `https://manicode.us` domain. Then click `Add to scope`.

![Burp Add Scope](../images/burp_add_scope.png?raw=true "Burp Add Scope")

2. Burp will ask you if you would like to stop sending out-of-scope items to history or other Burp Tools, click `Yes`. This will keep our scope tight and the noise out.

3. Our `HTTP history` tab still looks messy. Let's add a filter to only show in-scope items.

Click the Filter bar:

![Burp Filter Bar](../images/burp_filter_bar.png?raw=true "Burp Filter Bar")

Now check the `Show only in-scope items` box under `Filter by request type`:

![Burp Show In-Scope](../images/burp_show_in_scope.png?raw=true "Burp Shoe In-Scope")

Click anywhere outside of the Filter box and now our HTTP history should only show requests/responses to the domains in scope (manicode.us).
