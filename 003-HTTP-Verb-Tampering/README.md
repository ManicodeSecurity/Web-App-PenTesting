# HTTP Verb Tampering
The HTTP specification includes request methods other than the standard GET and POST requests. A standards compliant web server may respond to these alternative methods in ways not anticipated by developers. As a developer or penetration tester, it is important to understand which HTTP verbs your application supports and ensure only the verbs supported are those needed to run the application.

### Using Nmap to Enumerate Supported HTTP Verbs 

For this exercise we will use the venerable tool [Nmap](https://nmap.org) to enumerate the supported HTTP verbs of a target webserver. There are several tools and techniques that can be used to carry out this type of scan. We use Nmap because it is bundled in Kali Linux and is extremely powerful for other testing scenarios beyond HTTP verb scanning.

We will be using Nmap script called [http-methods](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-methods.html) to help us quickly scan a target webserver. Another common method for HTTP verb enumeration is to use the network utility called `Netcat`. 

In the Kali Linux VM, open up the Terminal and run the following commands:

```
nmap --script http-methods manicode.us
```

The output will show us ports open as well as a list of supported HTTP verbs on the target webserver. Feel free to scan other sites. 

### Bonus
Run the Nmap `http-methods` script on the URL path where Security Shepard is hosted on the `manicode.us` domain.
