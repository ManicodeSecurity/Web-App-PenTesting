# SQL Injection
Injection flaws have been #1 on the OWASP Top Ten for years now. The ramifications of a successful SQL injection attack can vary from reading sensitive data, deleting data, and even running Operating System commands. This lab will explore how SQL injection flaws can be discovered from an attackers perspective through trial-and-error (manual testing) as well as automated tooling.

## Customer ID Lookup SQL Injection
In the Security Shepherd UI, click `Private -> SQL Injection 1`. The goal of `SQL Injection Challenge One` is to take what we learned in lecture about the dangers of injecting raw SQL into a form and try to exploit the vulnerability. 

Try several different SQL statements to see which ones are successful. 

## Customer Email Lookup SQL Injection
Similar to the Customer ID lookup, in this challenge we will attempt to exploit a SQL injection vulnerability. Go to `Corporal -> SQL Injection 2` in the Security Shepherd UI to begin the exercise.

The form only accepts a valid email addresses. Can you fit a SQL injection payload into an email that exploits the vulnerability? 


## Bonus 1
Can you complete SQL Injection Challenge Three? 

## Bonus 2: Automated SQL Injection Fuzzing
In the real world, looking for SQL injection flaws manually is extremely time consuming and often times is not successful. The popular tool [sqlmap](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap), can help speed up the task. Check out the documentation for sqlmap and try to run it against one of the SQL injection challenges in Security Shepherd. 

Tip: You will need to use a number of flags in sqlmap including the `--cookie` flag to send your Session ID along with each payload.
