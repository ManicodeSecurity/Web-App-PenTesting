# CSRF GET Request

The goal of this lab is to show the issues around using `GET` requests to change state or perform an action. 

In the Security Shepherd UI, visit `Sergeant -> CSRF 1` to begin the challenge. 

This challenge provides a image sharing forum which allow users to share any image link. As a result, we can put CSRF URL in the forum and force another user to submit it on their behalf. Your goal is to force another user to increase your CSRF counter through `GET /user/csrfchallengeone/plusplus?userid=yourID`

 ### Discussion Question
 How can this increment counter be implemented in a secure way?
