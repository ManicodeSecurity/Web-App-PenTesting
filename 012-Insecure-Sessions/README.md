# Insecure-Sessions

### Elevate to Admin
In this exercise, we will use what we learned about intercepting HTTP requests to actually tamper with some data to eventually elevate to admin. Go to `Private -> Session Management Challenge One` 

1. Use our running Burp Suite application to intercept and modify the traffic. Remember, to use the `Proxy -> Intercept` tool within Burp to capture the request. 

### Password Reset Woes 
In the Session Management Two challenge located at `Sergeant -> Session Management Challenge 2` in the Security Shepherd UI, we are going to use our intercepting proxy again to defeat the login and password reset mechanisms.

### Bonus
Security Shepherd has a number of Session Management challenges. Can you work through the rest of them?
