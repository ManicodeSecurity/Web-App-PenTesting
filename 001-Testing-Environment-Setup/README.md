# Testing Environment Setup

The goal of this lab is to successfully setup an environment to begin testing for vulnerabilities in web applications. We will use this environment throughout the remainder of the labs.

## Requirements
To minimize software and configuration on your local machine, will be using a virtual machine that has the tools we will be using pre-configured. The Linux distribution is called [Kali Linux](https://tools.kali.org/).

An up-to-date version of Vagrant and Virtualbox are both required to spin up the Kali Linux VM.

[Download VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

[Download Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

### 1. Clone this Repository on your Local Machine
Open up the Terminal application on your laptop and run the following commands. Feel free to clone the repo anywhere you'd like (we are using the Desktop in the examples):
```
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/ManicodeSecurity/Web-App-PenTesting.git
cd Web-App-PenTesting/001-Testing-Environment-Setup
```

### 2. Use Vagrant to Launch the Kali Linux VM
In the `001-Testing-Environment-Setup` directory run the following command to spin up the VM using Vagrant:

```
vagrant up
```

This should kick off the Kali Linux VM boot process. Give it a few minutes.

### 3. Log into Kali Linux
Once the VM has booted up you should be presented with a login screen. The default credentials are:

```
username: vagrant
password: vagrant
```
Feel free to browse the testing tools included in the VM.

### 4. Launch Security Shepherd
[OWASP Security Shepherd](https://github.com/OWASP/SecurityShepherd) is an intentionally vulnerable web and mobile application security training platform. Security Shepherd has been designed to improve security awareness among a varied skill-set demographic. We will be using Security Shepherd throughout the remainder of the labs.

In the Kali Linux VM, open up the Firefox web browser and visit [https://manicode.us/shepherd](https://manicode.us/shepherd) then click `Register a Security Shepherd Account`.

Enter registration info as follows:
```
Username: <username-companycode>
Password: <not-your-banking-password>
Email Address: <training@manicode.us>
```
For simplicity, email is disabled on this Security Shepherd instance. You will be taken to a blank screen after you entered your registration information. Go back to [https://manicode.us/shepherd](https://manicode.us/shepherd) and enter the credentials that you created. 

You should now be logged in and ready to use Security Shepherd!
