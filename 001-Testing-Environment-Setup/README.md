# Testing Environment Setup

The goal of this lab is to successfully setup an environment to begin testing for vulnerabilities in web applications. We will use this environment throughout the remainder of the labs.

## Requirements
To minimize software and configuration on your local machine, will be using a service called [AWS Workspaces](https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/) which provides you with access to a Debian Linux box with all of the necessary tools installed directly from your browser. Workspaces supports the latest versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Internet Explorer 11+ and Apple Safari 8+.
