# Intercepting and Manipulating Requests
The power of proxying all web traffic through an intercepting proxy such as burp is that we get to stop these requests in flight and manipulate them before they are sent to the server. Many high-impact web application flaws are discovered this way.

### Intercept the Login POST Request
First, in the `Proxy` tab of Burp Suite, click the `Intercept` tab. Now, we want to enable active interception of requests by clicking the button that says `Intercept is off`. Now it should read `Intercept is on`. 

Go to the Firefox web browser and log in with your Security Shepherd credentials. You will see that the request has been intercepted and "stalled". You will also see the full HTTP POST request in your Burp proxy tab.

This request will sit here until you do something with it. Click the `Forward` button to send the request as-is to the server.

You will also see that the `HTTP history` tab is filling up with requests (including any modified requests you have made using Interception).

### Bonus
Use the Intercept feature to modify some requests and see if you can get the application to behave in an unexpected manner. 

### Discussion Question
What fields would you begin to tamper if you were put on a penetration test of this application?
